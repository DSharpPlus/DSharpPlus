## Migration From DiscordSharp

### Connecting
```cs
// Old.
var discord = new DiscordClient("My First Token", true);

discord.SendLoginRequest();
discord.Connect();
```
The constructor of the `DiscordClient` now requires a `DiscordConfiguration` object instead of a simple string token and boolean.
```cs
// New.
var discord = new DiscordClient(new DiscordConfiguration
{
    Token = "your token",
    TokenType = TokenType.Bot
});

await discord.ConnectAsync();
await Task.Delay(-1);
```
New versions of DSharpPlus implement [TAP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap), 
and the all DSharpPlus methods ending with *async* will need to be `await`ed within an asynchronous method.

### Events
While the signature will look similar, many changes have been done to events behind the scenes.

```cs
discord.MessageReceived += async (sender, arg) =>
{
    // Code here
};
```
We have a small article covering DSharpPlus events [here](xref:beyond_basics_events).
