# Halp! I tried ~~hard drugs~~ Mono and my bot crashes on start!

Mono is an open-source implementation of the .NET Framework for non-Windows operating systems. However, it has a large 
number of flaws, some of which break support for DSharpPlus without extra effort. Due to this we do not support the use 
of mono nor will give any guides on how to use it. With dotnet core and soon to be .Net 5, you can now run your dotnet
applications cross platform and it is offically supported by Microsoft which in turn is supported by DSharpPlus.  

## I must absolutely use Mono!

If you insist on using a broken runtime, I cannot stop you. However with most problems, you will be on your own and no
support will be provided to you.  This was your last warning to turn around and not drown.
