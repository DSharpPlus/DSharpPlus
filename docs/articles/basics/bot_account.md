# Creating a Bot Account

## Create an Application

Before you're able to create a [bot account][0] to interact with the Discord API, you'll need to create a new OAuth2
application. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal][1] and click `New Application` at the top right of the page.

![Discord Developer Portal][2]

You'll then be prompted to enter a name for your application.

![Naming Application][3]

The name of your application will be the name displayed to users when they add your bot to their Discord server. With
that in mind, it would be a good idea for your application name to match the desired name of your bot.

Enter your desired application name into the text box, then hit the `Create` button.

After you hit `Create`, you'll be taken to the application page for your newly created application.

![Application Page][4]

That was easy, wasn't it?

Before you move on, you may want to upload an icon for your application and provide a short description of what your bot
will do. As with the name of your application, the application icon and description will be displayed to users when
adding your bot.

## Add a Bot Account

Now that you have an application created, you'll be able to add a brand new bot account to it.

Head on over to the bot page of your application by clicking on `Bot` in the left panel. From there, click on the
`Add Bot` button at the top right of the page.

Then confirm the creation of the bot account.

# Using Your Bot Account

## Invite Your Bot

Now that you have a bot account, you'll probably want to invite it to a server!

A bot account joins a server through a special invite link that'll take users through the OAuth2 flow; you'll probably
be familiar with this if you've ever added a public Discord bot to a server. To get the invite link for your bot, head
on over to the OAuth2 page of your application.

![OAuth2][7]

<br/>
We'll be using the *OAuth2 URL Generator* on this page. Simply tick `bot` under the *scopes* panel; your bot invite link
will be generated directly below.

![OAuth2 Scopes][8]

<br/>
By default, the generated link will not grant any permissions to your bot when it joins a new server. If your bot
requires specific permissions to function, you'd select them in the *bot permissions* panel.

![Permissions][9]

The invite link in the *scopes* panel will update each time you change the permissions. Be sure to copy it again after
any changes!

## Get Bot Token

Instead of logging in to Discord with a username and password, bot accounts use a long string called a *token* to
authenticate. You'll want to retrieve the token for your bot account so you can use it with DSharpPlus.

Head back to the bot page and click on `Click to Reveal Token` just above the `Copy` and `Regenerate` buttons to take a
peek at your token.

![Token Reveal][10]

Go ahead and copy your bot token and save it somewhere. You'll be using it soon!

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Handle your bot token with care! Anyone who has your token will have access to your bot account.
> Be sure to store it in a secure location and *never* give it to *anybody*.
>
> If you ever believe your token has been compromised, be sure to hit the `Regenerate` button (as seen above) to
> invalidate your old token and get a brand new token.

## Write Some Code

You've got a bot account set up and a token ready for use. Sounds like it's time for you to [write your first bot][11]!
