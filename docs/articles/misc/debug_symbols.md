# I want to diagnose a problem I believe originates from the library, how do?

In the event you need to debug DSharpPlus, we offer debug symbols. They are available at the following locations:

## Symbol sources

There are 2 symbol sources available:

* Stable: [http://srv.symbolsource.org/pdb/Public](http://srv.symbolsource.org/pdb/Public)
* Nightly: [https://nuget.emzi0767.com/api/v3/symbolstore](https://nuget.emzi0767.com/api/v3/symbolstore)

## Using the symbols

In Visual Studio:

2. Go to Tools > Options > Debugging > Symbols, and add the URL in there.
