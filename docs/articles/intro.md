# Introduction

## Prerequisites 
Before attempting to write a Discord bot, you should be familiar with the concepts of [Object Oriented Programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [the C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/), and [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap).

If you're brand new to C#, or programming in general, this library may prove difficult for you to use.</br>
Fortunately, there are resources that can help you get started with the language! 

An exellent tutorial series to go through would be [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners) by Bob Tabor.
His videos go through all the basics, from setting up your development environment up to some of the more advanced concepts. 
If you're not sure what to do first, Bob's tutorial series should be your starting point!

## Getting Started
If you're writing a Discord bot for the first time, you'll want to start with [creating a bot account](xref:basics_bot_account).</br>
Otherwise, if you have a bot account already, start off with the *[writing your first bot](xref:basics_first_bot)* article.</br>

Once you're up and running, feel free to browse through the [API Documentation](/api/index.html)!

## Supported/Unsupported Runtimes/Environments
With regards of supported frameworks and specific versions, we currently target .Net Standard 2.0 (.Net Standard 1.3 is being dropped shortly). With this 
said we formally support the latest non-preview and LTS versions of .Net Core, however any other targets such as .NETFX, Xamarin, etc may work perfectly but it is untested.

Other frameworks such as Mono or running on hardware such as a Raspberry Pi 0/1 will not be supported due to legacy or flaws associated with them. Although you are more 
than welcome to ~~bang your head in circles~~ attempt to use these hardware/frameworks, you will not under any circumstance get any support when things break.
