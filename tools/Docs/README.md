In our [docs.yml](../../.github/workflows/docs.yml) workflow, we use the `docfx` tool to generate our API documentation. We then use this tool to generate the extensions. We're unsure on why there's inconsistent behavior, however everything works with our current setup.

You may submit a PR to fix this issue, but we're unsure on how and will continue to use our workaround in the mean time.
