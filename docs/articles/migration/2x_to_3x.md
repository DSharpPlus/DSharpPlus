# Migration From 2.x to 3.x

Major breaking changes:

 * Most classes were organized into namespaces.
 * Several classes and methods were renamed to maintain consistency with the rest of the library.
 * All events were renamed to be in the past tense.
 * `DiscordEmbed` instances are no longer constructed directly. 
   * Instead, they are built using a `DiscordEmbedBuilder`.
 * All colors are now passed as instances of `DiscordColor`.
 * Command modules are now based on an abstract class rather than an interface.
 * A brand-new ratelimit handler has been implemented.

## Fixing namespace issues.
Entities such as `DiscordUser`, `DiscordChannel`, and similar are in the `DSharpPlus.Entities` namespace, exceptions in `DSharpPlus.Exceptions`,
event arguments in `DSharpPlus.EventArgs`, and network components in `DSharpPlus.Net`.

Be sure to add these namespaces to your `using` directives as needed.

## Class, Method, and Event Renames

Several classes and methods were renamed to fit the current naming scheme in the library.

2.X|3.X|
:---:|:---:
`DiscordConfig`|`DiscordConfiguration`
`CommandExecutedEventArgs`|`CommandExecutionEventArgs`
`SnowflakeObject.CreationDate`|`SnowflakeObject.CreationTimestamp`
`VoiceReceivedEventArgs`|`VoiceReceiveEventArgs`
`DiscordMessage.EditAsync()`|`DiscordMessage.ModifyAsync()`
`SocketDisconnectEventArgs`|`SocketCloseEventArgs`
`DiscordMember.TakeRoleAsync()`|`DiscordMember.RevokeRoleAsync()`
`MessageReactionRemoveAllEventArgs`|`MessageReactionsClearEventArgs`
 
Additionally, all events received a rename to maintain consistent naming across the library with many receiving an *d* or *ed* to the end of their name.



## Embed woes

Embeds can no longer be constructed or modified directly. Instead, you have to use the embed builder. For the most part, this 
can be achieved using Find/Replace and doing `new DiscordEmbed` -> `new DiscordEmbedBuilder`.

On top of that, to add fields to an embed, you no longer create a new list for fields and assign it to `Fields`, but instead 
you use the `.AddField()` method on the builder.

To modify an existing embed, pass said embed to builder's constructor. The builder will use it as a prototype.

## Color changes

This one is easy to fix for the most part. For situation where you were doing e.g. `Color = 0xC0FFEE`, you now do 
`Color = new DiscordColor(0xC0FFEE)`. This has the added advantage of letting you create a color from 3 RGB values or parse 
an RGB string.

## Default channel removal

`DefaultChannel` no longer exists on guilds, and, as such, `DiscordGuild.CreateInviteAsync()` is also gone, as it relied on 
that property.

The new concept of "default" channel is a fallback, and is basically top channel the user can see. In the library this is 
facilitated via `DiscordGuild.GetDefaultChannel()`.

## Module changes

The `IModule` interface was removed, and replaced with `BaseModule` class. The most notable change is that your module should 
no longer define the field which holds your instance of `DiscordClient`, as that's on the base class itself. On top of that, 
you need to change modifiers of `.Setup()` from `public` to `protected internal override`.

## New ratelimit handler

This does not actually cause any in-code changes, however the behavior of the REST client and the way requests are handled 
changes drastically.

The new handler is thread-safe, and uses queueing to handle REST requests, and should bucket requests properly now.
