# I like living on the edge - give me the freshest builds

We offer nightly builds for DSharpPlus. They contain bugfixes and new features before the stable releases, however they
are not guaranteed to be stable, or work at all.

Simply open the NuGet interface for your project, check **Prerelease** and select **Latest prerelease** version of
the DSharpPlus packages, and install them.

If you find any problems in the nightly versions of the packages, please follow the instructions in
[Reporting issues][0] article.
