# Summary
First, give a brief description of what's going on. This can be something like: A `NullReferenceException` occurs when 
trying to send a message with no content to a channel. Is this a suggestion? Maybe an idea? Describe it shortly. 
Remember, this might decide about the priority of your issue.

# Details
Next up, the more detailed description. If reporting a problem, you should put as much information about your 
environent, exceptions, etc. in here. This includes, but is not limited to, .NET Framework version (eg. .NETFX 4.5, 
.NET Core 2.0), operating system (Windows 7, Debian GNU/Linux 9, etc.), changes made (e.g. custom WebSocket client 
implementation), IDE (e.g. Visual Studio 2017), exception type, message, and stack trace.

Remember to include all of your messages in text, as nobody likes a screenshot of text. A good idea is to wrap stack 
traces in codeblocks, like this:

```
at SomeClass.SomeMethod() at N:\MyBot\SuperAwesomeCommands.cs: line 42
at SomeBot.Main(string[])
```
