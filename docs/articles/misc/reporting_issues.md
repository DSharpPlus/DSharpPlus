# I broke something, and I need it fixed!

We always try to fix bugs, and make sure that when we release the next version of DSharpPlus, everything is polished and 
working. However, DSharpPlus is a large codebase, and we can't always catch all the bugs, or notice all the regressions 
that happen while we fix bugs or implement new issues.

## GitHub issue tracker

If you find a bug, come up with a new idea, or just want to report something, you can open an issue on our 
[GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus/issues "DSharpPlus issues on GitHub").

When opening an issue, make sure to include as much detail as possible. If at all possible, please include:

* Steps to reproduce the issue
* What were you trying to achieve
* Expected/acutal result
* Stack traces, exception types, messages
* Attempted solutions

## Discord 

Some questions, most notably questions on using the library, are better asked on Discord. You can find the server links on the [preamble](xref:preamble).

## Contributing

Lastly, while we understand that not everyone is an expert programmer, we would appreciate it if you could fix any issues you 
find and submit a Pull Request on GitHub. This would reduce the amount of work we would have to do.

When contributing, ensure your code matches the style of the rest of the library, and that you test the changes you make, and 
catch any possible regressions.
