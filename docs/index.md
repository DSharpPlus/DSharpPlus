## DSharpPlus Documentation
[DSharpPlus][1] (D#+) is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the [Discord API][2] which was originally a fork of
[DiscordSharp][3]. The library has since been rewritten to fit quality and API standards as well as target wider range
of .NET implementations.

## Getting Started
New users will want to take a look through the [articles][4] for quick start guides, tutorials, and examples of use.
Once you've gotten through the articles, head on over to the [API Documentation][5] for all classes and methods provided
by this library.

## Source and Contributors

The repository containing the source code for this library can be found [here][1]. Contributions are welcomed.

DSharpPlus is built by [Naamloos][7], [Emzi0767][8], [Axiom][9], [afroraydude][10], [DrCreo][11], [TiaqoY0][12],
[Neuheit][13], [SSG/Maxine][14], [and many others...][15]
