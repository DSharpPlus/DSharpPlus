# This is not DSharpPlus.

So you've stumbled upon my bastardised, heavily stripped down version of D#+, for use in personal projects. Well done, now, piss off :P

This is obviously unsupported, for fucks sake don't bother Emzi with this, I'll do that when I can't figure out how the fuck their code works.
