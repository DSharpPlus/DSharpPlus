# Using a Third Party Logger

While the default logging implementation will meet the needs of most, some may desire to make use of a more robust
implementation which provides more features. Thankfully, DSharpPlus allows you to use any logging library which has an
implementation for the [logging abstractions][0] provided by Microsoft.

[Serilog][1], one of the more popular logging libraries, will be used to demonstrate. This will simply be a brief demo,
so we won't go into the configuration of Serilog. You'll want to head on over to their [wiki page][2] to learn about
that!

We'll need to install both the `Serilog` and `Serilog.Extensions.Logging` packages from NuGet, along with at least one
of the many available [sinks][3]. Our example here will only use the `Serilog.Sinks.Console` sink.

Start off by creating a new `LoggerConfiguration` instance, slap `.WriteTo.Console().CreateLogger()` onto the end of it,
then directly assign that to the static `Logger` property on the `Log` class.

```cs
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .CreateLogger(); 
```

This will make a new Serilog logger instance which will write to the console sink.

Next, create a new variable and assign it a new `LoggerFactory` instance which calls `AddSerilog()`.

```cs
var logFactory = new LoggerFactory().AddSerilog();
```

Then assign that variable to the @DSharpPlus.DiscordConfiguration.LoggerFactory property of your of
@DSharpPlus.DiscordConfiguration.

```cs
new DiscordConfiguration()
{
    LoggerFactory = logFactory
}
```

Altogether, you'll have something similar to this:

```cs
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Serilog;

public async Task MainAsync()
{
    Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
        .WriteTo.Console()
        .CreateLogger();

    var logFactory = new LoggerFactory().AddSerilog();
    var discord = new DiscordClient(new DiscordConfiguration()
    {
        LoggerFactory = logFactory
    });
}
```

And that's it! If you now run your bot, you'll see DSharpPlus log messages formatted and displayed by Serilog.
