# Lavalink - the newer, better way to do music
[Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink) is a standalone program, written in Java, using JDA. It's a 
lightweight solution for playing music from sources such as YouTube or 
Soundcloud. Unlike raw voice solutions, such as VoiceNext, Lavalink can handle 
hundreds of concurrent streams, and supports sharding.

## Configuring Java
In order to run Lavalink, you must have Java 11 or greater installed.
The latest releases can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Make sure the location of the newest JRE's bin folder is added to your system variable's path. This will make the `java` command run from the latest runtime. You can verify that you have the right version by entering `java -version` in your command prompt or terminal.

## Downloading Lavalink  
Next, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases) tab on the Lavalink Github page. and download the Jar file from the latest version.

The program will not be ready to run yet, you will need to create a config file first.
