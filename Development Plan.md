# Development Plan
The v5 rewrite has long been in planning, with little to no central place to keep track of all of the details. To remedy this, here's where you can find all of the ideas set in stone. V5 should be implemented in an orderly process, one at a time. The following sections outline the steps to be taken in which order.

# DSharpPlus.Core
This project will contain raw entities that correctly reflect the current Discord API. Entities can be found over on the [Discord Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). This part of the lib is meant for power users.

DSharpPlus.Core will have no cache, no "convenience" properties such as `DiscordUser.DefaultAvatarUrl` or any other extra features. **This packages acts as if there was a breaking change in the API and assumes that the user using the package knows what they're doing. There are no verification checks, no convienience properties, no caching, no anything except "core" functionality.**

Note: Every async method in Core should be implemented using `ValueTask`s, wherever possible. If a method cannot be implemented using `ValueTask`, `Task` may be used; and a comment or `<remarks>` xmldocs tag should be left explaining why `ValueTask` was out of the question, in order to prevent future changes reverting the original choice without knowing why that choice was taken in the first place.

## Raw Entities
Try to copy the documentation in `<summary>` XML tag, with any exceptions or notes in the `<remarks>` XML tag. If you feel further clarification is required, you're welcome to add your own notes in a `<para>` XML tag.

We have our own implementation of `Snowflake`s and `Optional<T>`s, which should be put to the fullest use whenever possible. Our goal is to copy entities as closely as we can.

We're following v4 practice and having entities be placed in `DSharpPlus.Core/Entities/<subfolder>/` using the `DSharpPlus.Entities` namespace. Provided your IDE/Editor follows the `.editorconfig` rules, there shouldn't be any warnings or notices about this.

## Clients
The clients will be implemented in the following order:
- `DiscordRestClient`
- `DiscordGatewayClient`
- `DiscordClient`
- `DiscordShardedClient`

## Rest Requests
Rest Requests still belong on their proper objects, much like their v4 counterparts. The `DiscordRestClient` will have their own methods which allow making requests to undocumented endpoints. Something like such:
```cs
public async Task EditMessageAsync(this DiscordMessage message, DiscordClient client, DiscordMessage newMessage, string? reason) =>
    client.DoRestRequestAsync(new RestRequestPayload {
    	Payload = new EditMessagePayload(newMessage), // Implicit conversion to JSON string with supported properties
    	Headers = new[] { $"X-Audit-Log-Reason: {reason}" } // Will likely be turned into a dictionary
    	Url = new DiscordApiUrl("/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}", channelId, messageId) // Implicit conversation to string
    });
```

## Async Events
Events will need to be asynchronous. Due to our current async lib made by Emzi, only v4 has permission to use it. This means we'll have to remake async events on v5. Further discussion about the implementation will be held on the Discord.

# DSharpPlus.Abstraction
This is the part of the lib that people will likely use. It holds a cache, it has convenience properties and other positive features. Each class will internally hold a reference to its raw entity, likely shown as below:
```cs
public sealed class DSharpUser : IDiscordCoreObject<DiscordUser> { // Inheritance will allow for implicit conversion which prevents us from having to reimplement `DiscordClient` for the abstracted entities.
    // We do this so we can hide properties while still allowing users to access the core entity if required (casting).
	internal DiscordUser IDiscordCoreObject.CoreObject { get; init; }
	public DefaultAvatarUrl => $"https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/{(this.CoreObject.Discriminator % 5).ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)}.png?size=4096"; // This url should be using the ENDPOINTS static class
}
```

# Extensions
Everyone wants to rewrite the current extensions. We've received several verbal confirmations that there would be multiple people who'd help contribute. As things are right now though, it's too early to start even dreaming how the extensions would look. We acknowledge that there are many existing ideas, both new and old, desperately wanting to be implemented. As stated before, it's just too early. We know for sure that the following extensions *will*  be remade:

| Extension Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| TextCommands | Text-Based commands, such as `!ping` |
| InteractionCommands | Contains everything related to interactions. Slash commands, user and message (not text!) commands, buttons and modals. |
| Interactivity | Contains asynchronous methods that usually involves waiting (I.E, next message on channel, interactable help menus that use buttons and waiting for modal input) |
| VoiceNext | An extension that allows interfacing with voice channels, capable of both receiving and sending packets. |
| HybridCommands | A mix of both text and slash commands, additionally accounting for whatever new forms of user input that Discord brings to the table. |

There are no other extensions currently planned, however, the extensions API will be focused on a bit more. It is still undecided on whether the extensions API will reflect `DSharpPlus.Core`, `DSharpPlus.Abstraction`, or both.
# That's it!
That's how DSharpPlus v5.0.0 is expected to look. The development plans are expected to change at any time but usually not without major chatting beforehand in #lib-discussion. If you have any questions, you're welcome to ask in #lib-discussion, which can be found in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dsharpplus).

# Our current progress
- [ ] DSharpPlus.Core
    - [x] Translate rest and gateway entities from Discord Documentation.
    - [ ] Create (de)serialization tests utilizing the [Discord Payloads Github repo](github.com/discord-payloads/discord-payloads). Ran on every commit/PR through GH actions
    - [ ] Create `DiscordRestClient`
    - [ ] Create `DiscordGatewayClient`
      - [ ] Async events
    - [ ] Create `DiscordClient` (merges the two while providing extra functionality, undetermined at the moment)
    - [ ] Create `DiscordShardedClient` (still undecided on whether this should be done or to make a proper service which manages shards)
- [ ] DSharpPlus.Abstraction
  - [ ] Created abstracted versions of the core entities (`DSharpUser`, `DSharpGuild`, etc) which correctly calculates the available properties (`DefaultAvatarUrl`, `IsWebhook`, etc)
  - [ ] Create implicit abstract to core casts and explicit core to abstract casts (may change due to events)

In any order after the above are complete:
- [ ] DSharpPlus.HybridCommands
    - [ ] DSharpPlus.TextCommands
    - [ ] DSharpPlus.InteractionCommands
- [ ] DSharpPlus.Interactivity
- [ ] DSharpPlus.VoiceNext

More items will be expanded upon as the project progresses. Right now what is on the list is known and confirmed to be implemented. General speculation or ideas will be added upon when we get closer to implementing what said ideas rely on.
