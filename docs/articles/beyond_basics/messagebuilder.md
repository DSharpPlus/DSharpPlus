title: Message Builder

## Background
Before the message builder was put into place, we had one large method for sending messages along with 3 additional methods for sending files. This
was becoming a major code smell and it was hard to maintain and add more params onto it. Now we support just sending a simple message, an embed, a simple
message with an embed, or a full fledged message builder.

## Using the Message Builder
The API Documentation for the message builder can be found at @DSharpPlus.Entities.DiscordMessageBuilder but here we'll go over some of the concepts of using the
message builder:

### Adding a File:
For sending files, you'll have to use the MessageBuilder to construct your message, see example below:

```cs
 using (var fs = new FileStream("ADumbFile.txt", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
 {
    var msg = await new DiscordMessageBuilder()
        .WithContent("Here is a really dumb file that I am testing with.")
        .WithFiles(new Dictionary<string, Stream>() { { "ADumbFile1.txt", fs } })
        .SendAsync(ctx.Channel);           
}
```
OR

```cs
var msg = await new DiscordMessageBuilder()
    .WithContent("Here is a really dumb file that I am testing with.")
    .WithFile("./ADumbFile.txt")
    .SendAsync(ctx.Channel);
```

### Adding Mentions
For sending mentions, you'll have to use the MessageBuilder to construct your message, see example below:

```cs
var msg = await new DiscordMessageBuilder()
    .WithContent($"âœ” UserMention(user): Hey, {user.Mention}! Listen!")
    .WithAllowedMentions(new IMention[] { new UserMention(user) })
    .SendAsync(ctx.Channel);      
```

### Sending TTS Messages
For sending a TTS message, you'll have to use the MessageBuilder to construct your message, see example below:

```cs
var msg = await new DiscordMessageBuilder()
    .WithContent($"This is a dumb message")
    .HasTTS(true)
    .SendAsync(ctx.Channel);      
```
### Sending an Inline Reply
For sending an inline reply, you'll have to use the MessageBuilder to construct your message, see example below:
```cs
var msg = await new DiscordMessageBuilder()
    .WithContent($"I'm talking to *you*!")
    .WithReply(ctx.Message.Id)
    .SendAsync(ctx.Channel);
```
By default, replies do not mention. To make a reply mention, simply pass true as the second parameter:
```cs
// ...
    .WithReply(ctx.Message.Id, true);
// ...
```
